## My process

- I worked this through by following along with a the Grid Layout Lessons from Jeff Delaney: https://fireship.io/lessons/three-responsive-css-grid-layouts/. 
- This grid is an explicit grid where each element was placed in a specific area by name inside my grid container(parent). 
- The explicit grid use the grid-template-areas property to specify the positions. 
- From there I assigned each child element a number, added a photo inside their respective element and uploaded the 	base css file provided with the tutorials.

### What I learned

- How to make a easy gallery with an explicit grid, that allows a much easier way to place and position items inside of a grid.
- CSS is fun! ha!



 CSS code that I am proud of (Learning how to use the grid-template-areas): 
```css
    grid-template-areas:
    'a  b  c  d'
    'l  ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ e'
    'k  ðŸŒŸ ðŸŒŸ f'
    'j  i  h  g';

    grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 25%);
    grid-template-columns: 240px auto auto 240px;
```
